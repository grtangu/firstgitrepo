----------------------------- undo changes start here-------

Before Stage undo the changes in "filename:
git checkout "filename"

After Stage undo the changes in "filename:
git reset head "filename"
git checkout "filename"

----------------------------- undo changes end here-------

If you want to create new branch use the below command, it acutally create new branch from current pointed branch

If you want to switch from current branch to other branch use the below command
git checkout "branch-name"

If you want to see what are the commits happens recently use the below command
git log

If you want to see the difference between two comitted ids use the below command
git diff "commitid1" "commitid2"

If you want to see the latest top one commit details use the below command
git log --oneline

If you want to delete the branch use the below command
git branch -d "branch-name"
=====================

â€¦or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# firstgitrepo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main

--or if you have already in local repository with same name as remote repository and u want to move your local changes to sync with remote then use the below 2 command 
1.first command add your local repository to remote.
git remote add origin https://github.com/grtangu/firstgitrepo.git
2.second you are pushing your changes from local to remote.
git push -u origin main

git fetch vs git pull
git fetch ==> it will connect to remote repository and show the changes/differences from local to remote and it won't fetch the changes from remote to local
git pull ==> it will pull the changes from remote repository to local

git reset vs git revert
git reset --> use "reset" when you don't want get back the reverted changes(actually when we use reset command then prior to that commitid all the chagnes perminently removed from remote and we can'g get back)

git revert --> use "revert" when you don't want delete the recent changes but you wan't move  head to earlier git commit id.

let's assume there are 4 git commits happens you have reverted the last 2 git commmits and now you want get the changes from last 2nd git commit then you can use git cherrypick "last 2nd git commit id"

git cherrypick "requiredcommitid"


git reset --hard "commitid" 
git push -f 

git stash: It will put our local changes to a temporary location as we pull the latest or switch branches
----------
Suppose you have made some changes to your feature branch which are not moved to either staging or committed state. Inbetween you got a requirement to move to other branch
mean needs to checkout other branch in this scenario you will loose your local changes incase of if you wouldn't use stash command.
git stash

suppose if you we the above git stash command after later some time you want to work with your earlier made changes mean you need to get back those change to current branch
then use below command
git stash pop
